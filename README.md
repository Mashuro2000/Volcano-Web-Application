# Volcano Data Web Application

## Purpose & description

This application was designed for users to be able to access a collection of information about certain
volcanoes around the world. The application pulls data from the Smithsonian Institutionâ€™s Global
Volcanism Program. The data contains 1343 entries of different volcanoes. From the application the
user will be able to search from a specific country and see a list of different volcanoes from that
country. The user can then see the exact location of the volcano from an integrated map and other
metrics such as the summit, elevation, its last eruption, and region of the volcano.
The application also has the ability for the user to register for an account and authenticate themselves
so that they can see specific more in-depth data. If the user is logged in, they will be able to see the
population density of that volcano within a certain distance. The program utilizes the REST API created
from Swagger.
